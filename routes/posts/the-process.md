## Coding Solo

One of the reasons I was able to bring this project to completion is that I wasn't truly working alone on it. This was an idea that my group of game-playing friends came up with together, and their willingness to test it alongside me made a big difference. That, and my wife constantly giving feedback and being willing to listen to me talk about how the coding process was going. I might have been the only one actually writing code, but having other people involved along the way is what made it possible.

That being said, I _was_ in fact coding on my own. And I didn't want to fall into bad habits _(spoiler alert: it happened anyway)_. So I decided to actually maintain my project as if I was working with a team. Comments in the code, committing everything to github, and committing with descriptive messages. It didn't go all that well, I'm pretty sure my teammates would be complaining and I bet it's pretty difficult to dive into the code now and get up to speed. Still, there are actually a decent number of comments, a bit of organizational structure to the code, and there are many descriptive commit messages in the github repo.

## Coding Solo Doesn't Mean You're Alone

Even when you're coding alone, though, these teamworking skills are important because a solo coder is essentially a team of past, present, and future self. When I write bad documentation or leave it out entirely, I get lost if I don't work in that section of code for a while. There was a time when I stepped away from the project for a month, and coming back to it was really difficult.

Over time, I've really come to love the teaching to "code so that you can read it" - it's true that it's far easier to write code than to read it. Comments help a little bit, but it's easy to fall into the trap of "I'll remember that." For me, anytime I catch myself thinking that line, it's a red flag. I instantly know at this point that there will be a time in the future where I will regret those words. And so, I _(hopefully)_ will write a comment or de-obfuscate my code. _(Is there a better word for de-obfuscate?)_

One thing I haven't done is remember to write down how to get back into things, and that leads me to leave projects languishing. I should probably include comments for how to spin up the development server, because not remembering how to start the dev server is a surefire way to not do any more dev work! When coding alone, you still have to write instructions for your team on just about everything, but your team consists of different versions of yourself scattered throughout time _(in my case, unpredictably)_.

## Gathering a team

Eventually a couple other people became interested in looking at the code (which, by the way, is available at [https://github.com/alexalexalex09/tts](https://github.com/alexalexalex09/tts)). So solo projects can eventually become team projects. Especially if there's a possibility of selling off the project in the future! Writing to code is a completely different beast - for me, at least - than doing the artwork, the monetization, or the advertising. Unless you're only interested in a project for the academic nature of it, coding always involves other people.

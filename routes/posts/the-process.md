## Coding Solo

One of the reasons I was able to bring this project to completion is that I wasn't truly working alone on it. This was an idea that my group of game-playing friends came up with together, and their willingness to test it alongside me made a big difference. That, and my wife constantly giving feedback and being willing to listen to me talk about how the coding process was going. I might have been the only one actually writing code, but having other people involved along the way is what made it possible.

That being said, I _was_ in fact coding on my own. And I didn't want to fall into bad habits _(spoiler alert: it happened anyway)_. So I decided to actually maintain my project as if I was working with a team. Comments in the code, committing everything to github, and committing with descriptive messages. It didn't go all that well, I'm pretty sure my teammates would be complaining and I bet it's pretty difficult to dive into the code now and get up to speed. Still, there are actually a decent number of comments, a bit of organizational structure to the code, and there are many descriptive commit messages in the github repo.

## Coding Solo Doesn't Mean You're Alone

Even when you're coding alone, though, these teamworking skills are important because a solo coder is essentially a team of past, present, and future self. When I write bad documentation or leave it out entirely, I get lost if I don't work in that section of code for a while. There was a time when I stepped away from the project for a month, and coming back to it was really difficult.

Also, eventually a couple other people became interested in looking at the code (which, by the way, is available at https://github.com/alexalexalex09/tts). So solo projects can eventually become team projects. Especially if there's a possibility of selling off the project in the future!

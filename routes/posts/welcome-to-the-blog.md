Welcome to the blog for SelectAGame!

This has been quite the journey since January of 2020, before the pandemic and everything that came with it.

I have spent the past year learning node.js, express, and mongo to create this site. It's a labor of love, a site that I find personally useful, and also a weird mess of code. But I hope it will be useful to those who find it as well.

In this blog I'll talk a little bit about what it was like to code this behemoth and what I learned along the way.

Happy gaming!
